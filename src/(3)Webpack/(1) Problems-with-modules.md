# Problems with Modules

Working with modules in web development brings various benefits, such as improved code organization, reusability, and maintainability. However, there are still some challenges and considerations associated with module-based development. Here are some common issues.

## Browser Compatibility

While modern browsers generally support ECMAScript Modules (ESM), older browsers may not fully support the import and export syntax

## Performance Overhead

Loading numerous small modules individually can result in a performance overhead due to the increased number of HTTP requests. Tools like bundlers are often used to concatenate and minify modules to reduce the number and size of files sent to the client.

## Integration with Legacy Code

In projects with existing codebases that do not use modules, integrating a modular system may require careful planning and potentially introducing compatibility layers. Legacy code may not adhere to module-based conventions, leading to challenges in gradual adoption.
